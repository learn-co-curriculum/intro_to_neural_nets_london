# Introduction to Neural Networks

## Objectives
* [ ] To fluently use the vocabulary of neural networks
* [ ] To connect familiar past algorithms to neural networks 
* [ ] To practice drawing and specifying the parameters of a neural net
* [ ] To list the parameters one can adjust when building a neural net

By the end of this lecture you should be able to initialize, run and evaluate a basic neural network model in Keras.<br>
Stretch: if you can understand and use regularization and different activations functions, congrats!
